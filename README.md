# SkillCardUser
A small Addon to Help with Skill Cards in Project Ascension.

For now it will only display all unknown skill cards and make a clickable button to learn them. As long as the Skill Cards and Sealed Cards are classified in a way, that they are Protected a Automated Process is not possible. The inital start of the Automated Process is added aswell. I posted a Request to Reclassify these Items. If they change it in the Future i will update this Addon with a Full Automated Process.

Be aware this is an Addon in early Stage! Currently Version 0.0.1.

## Explenation
The Addon will constantly search your inventory for not onwed skill cards. Please dont leave the addon running as long as there is no Toggle On/Off command.
If he finds any not owned Skill Card he will create a Clickable button in ur UI. So you can spam open your Sealed cards and click on the Buttons. No more checking this Tooltip!!!!
Small Video how it looks and works:

- Clean up Code
- Add Support for turning in Cards by Skill Card Exchange
